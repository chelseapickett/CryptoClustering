# CryptoClustering

This challenge uses Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. 


The following steps show the process used in this challenge and are reflected in the jupyter notebook sections as well. All code for this challenge can be found in the [CryptoClustering.ipynb](https://github.com/chelseapickett/CryptoClustering/blob/main/Starter_Code/Crypto_Clustering.ipynb) file in the starter code folder.

- Prepare the Data
- Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame
- Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data
- Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
- Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
- Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
- Visualize and Compare the Results
